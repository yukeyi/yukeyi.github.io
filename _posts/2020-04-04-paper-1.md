We consider the problem of using a large unlabeled sample to boost performance of a 
learning algorit, hrn when only a small set of labeled examples is available. In particular, we 
consider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in whiWe consider the problem of using a large unlabeled sample to boost performance of a
